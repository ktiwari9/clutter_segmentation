ncuts: a port of Jianbo Shi's implementation of Normalized Cuts, from the paper

J. Shi, J. Malik, "Normalized Cuts and Image Segmentation", PAMI 2000

, to c++ from MATLAB by Evan Herbst, eherbst@cs.washington.edu. This code is the clustering method, nothing specific to images.

In addition to whatever licenses Shi has on his code, please include a statement that I wrote this code.

For Shi's code see http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/software/.


I installed boost, arpack and eigen from the ubuntu package repositories. I installed arpack++ from source so I could edit it to work with gcc-4.6. I've included the hacked copy in this distribution.
