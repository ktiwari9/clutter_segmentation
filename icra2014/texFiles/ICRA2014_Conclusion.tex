\section{Conclusion}
% We consider the problem of detection and pose estimation of semantically important objects versus background using a depth camera. Regardless of the quality of an object detector, the results from static recognition are affected adversely by occlusions, lighting, and scene variations. To address these issues we formulate hypotheses about the class and orientation of an unknown object and propose a soft detection strategy, in which the sensor moves to increase its confidence in the correct hypothesis. A non-myopic planning framework is used to balance the amount of energy spent for sensor motion with the benefit of decreasing the probability of incorrect decision. We demonstrated through simulation that our active detection framework outperforms static detection significantly. Additionally, we tested the algorithm on several real scenes and obtained very promising results.

% In future, work we plan to carry out additional real-world experiments in order to reproduce the analysis performed in simulation. On the theoretical side, we would like to investigate the effect of introducing sensor dynamics in the active M-ary hypothesis testing problem in order to obtain a suboptimal policy with performance guarantees.
